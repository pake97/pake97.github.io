excerpt: "We introduce Grafixer, an innovative interactive tool that enables human-in-the-loop repair of property graphs. By leveraging user expertise, Grafixer allows collaborative identification and correction of data inconsistencies while ensuring an efficient repair process. Users can upload property graph datasets and define constraints using Cypher, a widely adopted query language. The system efficiently manages overlapping data violations, ensuring that multiple users can work simultaneously on independent repairs without conflicts. Additionally, Grafixer provides an interactive dashboard that allows administrators to monitor real-time statistics, track progress, and oversee the repair process. In our demo, we showcase the complete repair workflow from both the administrator and users perspectives. Administrators can configure the repair process, monitor ongoing corrections, and assess the overall status of the graph. Meanwhile, users engage in the repair process by reviewing violations, proposing corrections, and contributing to improving data quality through an intuitive and guided interface."
