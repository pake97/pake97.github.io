Survey on French (Large) Language Models in Healthcare	
===

For this assignment, you are tasked with conducting a detailed survey of the current state of the art in language models designed for processing French in the healthcare domain. Explore a range of models, from large-scale general-purpose models like GPT or BLOOM to more specialized architectures such as BERT variants (e.g., CamemBERT or FlauBERT) and domain-specific adaptations (e.g., BioBERT or models fine-tuned on medical corpora). Investigate how these models perform on healthcare-related tasks such as medical text classification, named entity recognition (NER) for clinical terms, or question-answering for patient data. Discuss the datasets used for training or fine-tuning these models, evaluation benchmarks, and how well these tools address challenges in healthcare contexts, such as handling sensitive data or specialized terminology. Your report should identify current gaps and propose potential future directions for research.

Survey on Data Quality for Graphs
===
In this assignment, you are required to conduct a comprehensive survey on the current state of the art in data quality methodologies for graph data. Your research should focus on techniques for ensuring consistency (e.g., constraints like functional dependencies, path constraints) and methods for repairing inconsistent or incomplete graph data. Consider the application of these methodologies across different graph data models, including labeled graphs, property graphs, and RDF (Resource Description Framework). Highlight the unique challenges and solutions associated with each model, such as handling schema heterogeneity in RDF or edge-labeling issues in property graphs. Discuss evaluation metrics, tools, and frameworks used to assess and improve data quality in graph-based systems, and identify potential research gaps or emerging trends in this domain.


Investigate the current status of the Resource Track at ISWC
===
For this assignment, you are tasked with investigating the current status of works published in the ISWC (International Semantic Web Conference) Resource Track. Your survey should focus on assessing whether the resources (e.g., datasets, ontologies, tools, benchmarks) are still available online, their level of maintenance or updates, and their current usage in research or industry. Analyze metrics such as citations, downloads, or integration into other projects to gauge their impact. Additionally, explore the factors that contributed to the success or lack of adoption of these resources, such as usability, documentation quality, community engagement, or alignment with evolving technological trends. Your report should provide insights into best practices for ensuring the longevity and relevance of resources in the Semantic Web community	Survey/Empirical


Survey on Causal Inference Analysis in Data Management
===
For this assignment, you are tasked with conducting a survey on the current state of the art in causal analysis within the field of data management.

Evaluate LLMs performance in reasoning over structured data	For this assignment, you are tasked with evaluating the performance of different large language models (LLMs) in reasoning over structured (tabular) data. You will design an experiment by selecting a set of LLMs to compare, defining the type of reasoning tasks to test (e.g., aggregation, filtering, join reasoning, or trend analysis), and identifying or creating tabular datasets for evaluation. Choose appropriate metrics to assess performance, such as accuracy, reasoning completeness, response time, or interpretability. Clearly document the experiment setting, including the prompts used, the evaluation criteria, and any preprocessing steps. Your report should analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each LLM in handling structured data and provide insights into their potential and limitations for tabular reasoning tasks.
